From match data query output as shown below:

create table icc_world_cup
(
Team_1 Varchar(20),
Team_2 Varchar(20),
Winner Varchar(20)
);
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('India','SL','India');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('SL','Aus','Aus');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('SA','Eng','Eng');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('Eng','NZ','NZ');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('Aus','India','India');

Solution: 

select
	team_1 as teams
	, count(team_1) as Matches_Played
	, sum(t1) as no_of_wins
	, count(team_1) - sum(t1) as no_of_losses
from
	(select 
		team_1
		, case when team_1 = winner then 1 else 0 end as t1
	from icc_world_cup

	union all

	select 
		team_2
		, case when team_2 = winner then 1 else 0 end as t1
	from icc_world_cup) as temp
group by team_1; 

/*
Solution:
team  play won loss
"SA"	1	0	1
"Eng"	2	1	1
"NZ"	1	1	0
"SL"	2	0	2
"Aus"	2	1	1
"India"	2	2	0
